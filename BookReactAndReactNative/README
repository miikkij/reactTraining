**//PLEASE NOTE//**

Following are the Chpaters with no Code bundle:
Chapter 1
Chapter 12
Chapter 25


Getting Started
===============

The first thing we'll need to do, before running
any of the code examples, is to install the dependencies.
This can be done as follows:

  cd path/to/code
  npm install

This will install all the NPM package dependencies used
by the various code examples. Next, you should make sure
that webpack is installed as a Global package:

  npm install -g webpack

Now you're ready to run the examples.

Running Examples
================

First, you need to change into the directory of the
example that you want to run:

  cd path/to/example

Then you can build the example by running:

  webpack-dev-server

Building React Native Projects
==============================

Each React Native example is it's own project. There are
a few steps that should be followed, in order to build and
run these projects. First of all, make sure you have the
react-native-cli package installed:

  npm install react-native-cli -g

Install Dependencies
--------------------

Just like any regular React web projects:

  cd path/to/code
  npm install

Install iOS and Android Build Files
-----------------------------------

When you start a React Native project, there're a number
of source files generated. They're not included in this
code bundle because it would be way too big. To generate
them, run:

  react-native upgrade

This will ask you about overwriting a number of files.
You can answer yes to all of them.

Run the project
---------------

From within the given code directory, run one of the
following:

  react-native run-ios
  react-native run-android
