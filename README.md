# My ramblings with React

React is very popular and it is time to expand my knowledge on this sector as well. I've done a lot with Angular 1 and 2, time to move on. 

# Repository structure

I'm reading different source materials (books and websites). Directories will be created by name of that site where I'm taking the information or name of the book. 

# Why?

Just a human. I make errors, I learn. It is important for others to see how path is formed in gathering certain knowledge. -Jouni
